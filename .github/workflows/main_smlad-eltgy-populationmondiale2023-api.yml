# This workflow will build and push a .NET Core app to an Azure Web App when a commit is pushed to your default branch.
#
# This workflow assumes you have already created the target Azure App Service web app.
# For instructions see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-dotnetcore?tabs=net60&pivots=development-environment-vscode
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Download the Publish Profile for your Azure Web App. You can download this file from the Overview page of your Web App in the Azure Portal.
#    For more information: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions?tabs=applevel#generate-deployment-credentials
#
# 2. Create a secret in your repository named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE, paste the publish profile contents as the value of the secret.
#    For instructions on obtaining the publish profile see: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-github-actions#configure-the-github-secret
#
# 3. Change the value for the AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME. Optionally, change the AZURE_WEBAPP_PACKAGE_PATH and DOTNET_VERSION environment variables below.
